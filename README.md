# Compilation and Debugging Guide

## 🐞 Error Description:

The code in `Matrix.cpp` has a logical error in the `Matrix::multiply` function. When we attempt to multiply two 
matrices,
it produces unexpected results.

**Wrong Code:**

```cpp
Matrix multiply(const Matrix& other) {
    if (cols != other.rows) {
        std::cout << "Matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication." << std::endl;
        return Matrix(0, 0);
    }

    Matrix result(rows, other.cols);

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < other.cols; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {
                result.data[i][j] = data[i][k] * other.data[k][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```
## 🛠️ Solution:
```cpp
Matrix multiply(const Matrix& other) {
    if (cols != other.rows) {
        std::cout << "Matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication." << std::endl;
        return Matrix(0, 0);
    }

    Matrix result(rows, other.cols);

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < other.cols; ++j) {
            result.data[i][j] = 0;  // Initialize the result element to 0.
            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {
                result.data[i][j] += data[i][k] * other.data[k][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

```

## 🚧 Error Handling:

Before Debugging:
- The code does perform some error handling by checking if the matrix dimensions are compatible for multiplication. If they are not compatible, it prints an error message and returns an empty matrix (`Matrix(0, 0)`).

After Debugging:
- After debugging, we will improve the error handling by throwing exceptions when the dimensions are incompatible. This will provide a more descriptive error message and allow better error management.
## 🔍 Debugging Steps:

1. **Compile the Code:**

   Use the following command to compile the code with debugging information:
    ```
     g++ -g -o Matrix Matrix.cpp 
   ```
2. **Start GDB:**

    Run GDB with your executable:
    ```
    gdb ./Matrix
    ```
3. **Excute commands:**
    Excute commands like commands in CompilationCommand.txt

## 🏁 Conclusion:
By following these steps and using GDB for debugging, you can identify and resolve the issue in the 
`Matrix::multiply` function, improve error handling, and ensure that matrix multiplication works correctly.
